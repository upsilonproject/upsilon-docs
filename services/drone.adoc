upsilon-drone will look for the following environment variables on startup;

[options = "header"]
|=======================================================================
| Environment Variable | Example          | Description                
| `UPSILON_IDENTIFIER` | test.example.com | The unique identifier for the node
| `UPSILON_CONFIG_SYSTEM_AMQPHOST` | amqp.example.com | The address of the AMQP Server 
|=======================================================================

upsilon-drone can be manually configured by a simple config.xml file, usually installed at
`/etc/upsilon-drone/config.xml` on most platforms. This is necessary if you
don't want to use central configuration management for some reason.
