Upsilon Ansible
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Note:* These ansible scripts are in very *early development*, they
help, but don't install a full environment. Only useful if you know
Upsilon pretty well right now. If you just want to play around with
Upsilon for testing, *don't use this method*.

The GitHub repository is stored and maintained here with documentation;
