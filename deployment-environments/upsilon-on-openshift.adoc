Upsilon on OpenShift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upsilon can be deployed quite easily on top of OpenShift 3 - all it's
services dockerized/containerized. You can scale-out of the OpenShift
environment and deploy upsilon-drone and other services outside too.

This article assumes you have a OpenShift 3 environment up and running,
and have a fairly reasonable quota.

Upload the Upsilon application template to OpenShift
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a pre-built Upsilon application template for OpenShift, stored
in a GitHub repository called
https://github.com/upsilonproject/upsilon-on-openshift[upsilon-on-openshift].

On your local workstation, clone this repository:

....

user@host: mkdir upsilon-sandbox && cd upsilon-sandbox
user@host: git clone https://github.com/upsilonproject/upsilon-on-openshift.git
user@host: cd upsilon-on-openshift

....

Login to OpenShift using the command line tool and upload the
application template.

....
user@host: oc new-project upsilon-on-openshift
user@host: oc status
In project Upsilon on OpenShift (upsilon-on-openshift) on server https://openshift.example.com:8443

You have no services, deployment configs, or build configs.
Run 'oc new-app' to create an application.

user@host: oc create -f upsilon-on-openshift.yaml
....


The application template should complete successfully, and you should be
able to browse and find Upsilon in the OpenShift catalog;

You can change some of the deployment options before starting the
deployment, but the defaults are fine.

When the pods deploy successfully, continue to the link:#_setup[Setup] section of this manual.
