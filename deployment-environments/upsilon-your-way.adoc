Upsilon your Way...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upsilon was designed to not be too presecriptive to the architectire it
runs on, as everyone has different environments and different
requirements.

Here are the high level requirements for running Upsilon

* DNS record "upsilon" that points to the AMQP server.
* Linux environment is largely expected, although parts of Upsilon might
run on windows or MacOS, this isn't tested really at all at the moment.
CentOS is used by the project developers, hence CentOS packages are
available. Debian based or other distributions are likely to work fine
though.

Here are some other deployment configurations that are known to work;

* Using 1 uspilon serivce to 1 docker container, then deploying on
OpenShift, or docker on it's own.
* Deploying every service inside a virtual machine.
