#### Launching the installer

upsilon-web will automatically launch the web installer if it cannot find a
config.php file. This happens when upsilon-web is initially installed (or it's
config file has been deleted).  

This is what the upsilon-web installer looks like;

#### System tests

Various common tests will run to check that upsilon-web can be installed
correctly. Everything should be green with a `PASS` in order to continue.

Most of these issues require additional packages to be installed, for example
the `pdoAvailable` check can be fixed by doing `yum install php-pdo` on some
systems.

#### Generate config.php

##### Database

When all the system tests have passed, you need to then configure the database
connection.

| Field          | Example                              | Description  
| DSN            | `mysql:host=myserver;dbname=upsilon` | See http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.construct.php for more information.
| Database user  | `admin`                              | The username of the user that the web interface will use to connect to the database.
| Database pass  | `toomanysecrets`                     | The password for your database username.
|==============================================================================

NOTE:  In some environments like OpenShift the username and password can be automatically completed for you as shown below. In other cases, you must specify the username and password of an existing MySQL user, or use the root user.

##### First administrator

The default first admin is `admin`, but you can change that here and set a
password that you like as well. Additional administrators can be configured
later too.
