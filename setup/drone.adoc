Drone
~~~~~

upsilon-drone is the workhorse of Upsilon, and you need at least one drone to get anything done.

Here's how the architecture works;

The upsilon-drone service ships with a "sample" configuration file that is ready to use in this simple deployment;

....
root@host: cd /etc/upsilon-drone/
root@host: cp config.xml.sample config.xml
....

We should now start the drone, which should pick up the configuration file

....
root@host: service upsilon-drone restart
....

Lets try and ping it;

....
root@host: upsilon-ping
Waiting 3 seconds for responses to pings.

Looks good. However, we need a custodian to write results to a database now...
